# [Android application] GetMusic Charts App

## Abstract

Most people today choose not only in their free time but also in their daily routine to listen to music anywhere they are at any time. For this reason various applications have been developed for each type of mobile devices, with different advantages and characteristics in each of them. Since each device has its own features, the apps to be developed must be on-line so that all users can access it without any issues. The applications that are currently available are: Youtube, Spotify, Shazam, Lastfm and others.
For this purpose an Android based mobile app has been deployed and has several users. The goal of this app is to gather some of the above online music tracking services so that the user can choose which one to use. Through the app, the user will be able to select some song lists which are available and then connect to his personal Spotify and Lastfm accounts and listen to whatever song he wants. Note that the user may choose to download the track he wants and save it to his device as well as check his download history.


## Aim And Usage

This app was created based on the idea that simple is also powerful!
I wanted to build an App that would allow me to manually manage many Music Steaming Services (like Spotify or Deezer) display their Charts (chart listings) and also download tracks offline from them.
In this application I chose Spotify, Deezer and Youtube Music Charts.

So I created an alpha-stage of my want-to-develop app. 

Currently features:
* [Youtube Charts](https://artists.youtube.com/charts/videos) with the possibility of retrieving charts and offline downloading in .mp3 format using [Youtubeinmp3](https://www.youtubeinmp3.com/).
* [Spotify](https://spotify.github.io/android-sdk/player/)  (Using Spotify Android API. For now it just playbacks music)
* [Deezer](https://developers.deezer.com/api) (Using Deezer Android API. For now it just playbacks music)

 
## How To use
You may go ahead and clone the project (or just download .zip) and then import it on Android Studio.

Please note that the app is in alpha-stage, thus it comes as is, with no warrantly or whatsoever.
