# [Android application] GetMusic Charts App

Abstract

Most people today choose not only in their free time but also in their daily routine to listen to music anywhere they are at any time. For this reason various applications have been developed for each type of mobile devices, with different advantages and characteristics in each of them. Since each device has its own features, the apps to be developed must be on-line so that all users can access it without any issues. The applications that are currently available are: Youtube, Spotify, Shazam, Lastfm and others.
For this purpose an Android based mobile app has been deployed and has several users. The goal of this app is to gather some of the above online music tracking services so that the user can choose which one to use. Through the app, the user will be able to select some song lists which are available and then connect to his personal Spotify and Lastfm accounts and listen to whatever song he wants. Note that the user may choose to download the track he wants and save it to his device as well as check his download history.
